\description{
Performs the four tests of equality of the p marginal distributions for two groups proposed in Cousido-
Rocha et al. (2018). The methods have been designed for the low sample size and high dimensional
setting. Furthermore, the possibility that the p variables in each data set can be weakly dependent is
considered. The function also reports a set of p permutation p-values, each of them is derived from testing
the equality of distributions in the two groups for each of the variables separately. These p-values are
useful when the proposed tests rejects the global null hypothesis since it is possible to identify which
variables have been contributed to this significance.
}
\details{
The function implements the two-sample tests proposed by Cousido-Rocha, et al. (2018).
The methods “spect”,“boot” and “us” are based on a global statistic which is the average of p individual statistics
corresponding to each of the p variables. Each of these individual statistics measure the difference
between the empirical characteristic functions computed from the two samples. An alternative expression
of them show that it can be interpreted as a difference between the variability in each of the two samples
and the variability in the combined sample. The global statistic (average) is standarized using different
variance estimators given place to the three different methods. The method “spect” uses a variance
estimator based on the spectral analysis theory, the method “boot” implements the block bootstrap to
estimate the variance and the method “us” employs a variance estimator derived from U-statistic theory
(more details in Cousido-Rocha et al., 2018). The methods “spect” and “boot” are suitable under
some theoretical assumptions which include that the sequence of individual statistics that defined the
global statistic is strictly stationary whereas the method “us” avoids such assumption. However the
methods “spect” and “boot” have been checked in simulations and they perform well even when such
assumption is violated. The methods “spect” and “us” have their corresponding version for independent
data (“spect ind” and “us ind”), for which the variance estimator is simplified taking into acount the
independence of the variables.
The asymptotic normality (when p tends to infinity) of the standardized version of the statistic is used
to compute the corresponding p-value. On the other hand, Cousido-Rocha et al. (2018) also proposed
the method “perm” whose global statistic is the average of the permutation p-values corresponding to
the individual statistics mentioned above. This method assumes that the sequence of p-values is strictly
stationary, however in simulations it seems that it performs well where this assumption does not hold.
Furthermore than defining a new global test these p-values can be also used when the global null hypothesis
is rejected and we need to identify which of the p variables have been contributed to that rejection.
The global statistic depends on a parameter which plays a similar role of a smoothing parameter
or bandwidth in kernel density estimation. For the four global tests this parameter is estimated using
the information of all the variables or features. For the individual statistics on based of which the
permutation p-values are computed, we have two possibilities: (a) use the value employed in the global
test (b I.permutation.p.values=“global”). (b) estimate this parameter for each variable independently
using only its sample information (b I.permutation.p.values=“individual”).
